# Mhammed Doukkali . Jarvis Consulting

As a dedicated software developer with a solid foundation in both web development and cloud computing, I bring a strong technical background to my five years of experience in the banking industry. My skill set includes expertise in COBOL, JCL, ISPF, DB2, and mainframe technologies, which complements my proficiency in Java, Linux, and Docker. My excellent track record in collaborating with team members, coupled with my ability to proactively address the needs of both customers and the organization, has honed my communication and problem-solving skills. My passion for software engineering began while working on a project to improve the online banking application. Intrigued by the power of programming to create and build solutions, I decided to enroll in an 'Introduction to Programming' course. Quickly, I found programming to be highly accessible and was thrilled to see the immediate results of my work in just a few lines of code. Currently, as an Applications and Data Engineer at Jarvis, I have sharpened my proficiency in various technologies and demonstrated my ability to work in a fast-paced environment to deliver high-quality solutions. I am eager to leverage my skills and knowledge to contribute to your team's success.

**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-MhammedDoukkali//tree/masterhttps://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-MhammedDoukkali/linux_sql)]: Implemented a monitoring agent in Bash that records the hardware specifications and usage of host machines over time and saves the data to a Postgres database running in a Docker container. The testing process involved using a CentOS 7 virtual machine on the Google Cloud Platform, and each script was manually tested to confirm that output expectations were met.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-MhammedDoukkali//tree/masterhttps://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-MhammedDoukkali/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Designed a Twitter application that follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, enabling users to execute CRUD operations via REST API. To build the application, I utilized various libraries such as Twitter API, HTTP client, OAuth authorization, and JSON serialization. During the development process, I conducted integration tests on all Java files using JUnit. Additionally, I employed the Mockito framework to test classes with dependencies, leveraging the ability to mock those dependencies.
  - JDBC App: Programmed a straightforward application that establishes a link between a Java program and a relational database management system (RDBMS) to access data. To enable create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations, I utilized the DAO (data access object) design patterns.
  - Grep App: Developed a Java program that imitates the grep command line function. The program performs a recursive search for a given pattern within a specified root directory and writes the matching lines to an output file. To efficiently list and filter files under the root directory while reducing memory usage, I utilized the Lambda and Stream API.


## Highlighted Projects
**ReachOut**: Developed full-stack web application that provides comprehensive information on both physical and mental health. Users can access a wide range of health-related articles on various topics, as well as track their physical activity and mental health using external REST APIs. Additionally, we have implemented a map feature focused on Montreal that allows users to find healthcare professionals and facilities for both physical and mental health. The application uses cutting-edge technologies such as JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, HTTP, and REST APIs, and we store user data securely in a MongoDB database.To ensure a seamless and user-friendly experience, we have utilized popular UI frameworks such as Material UI and Styled Components. Our code is hosted on GitHub, making it easy for developers to contribute and collaborate on the project.
