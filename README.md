# Mhammed Doukkali . Jarvis Consulting

As a recent graduate from Concordia University, I bring a strong technical foundation to my five years of experience in the banking industry. My excellent track record in collaborating with team members, coupled with my ability to proactively address the needs of both customers and the organization, has honed my communication and problem-solving skills. My passion for software engineering began while working on a project to improve the online banking application. Intrigued by the power of programming to create and build solutions, I decided to enroll in an 'Introduction to Programming' course. Quickly, I found programming to be highly accessible and was thrilled to see the immediate results of my work in just a few lines of code. Currently, as an Applications and Data Engineer at Jarvis, I have honed my proficiency in various technologies such as Java, Linux, and Docker. I have demonstrated my ability to work in a fast-paced environment and deliver high-quality solutions. I am eager to leverage my skills and knowledge to contribute to your team's succes.

**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-MhammedDoukkali//tree/masterhttps://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-MhammedDoukkali/linux_sql)]: Implemented a monitoring agent in Bash that records the hardware specifications and usage of host machines over time and saves the data to a Postgres database running in a Docker container. The testing process involved using a CentOS 7 virtual machine on the Google Cloud Platform, and I manually tested each script to confirm that it meets its specifications.


## Highlighted Projects
**ReachOut**: Developed full-stack web application that provides comprehensive information on both physical and mental health. Users can access a wide range of health-related articles on various topics, as well as track their physical activity and mental health using external REST APIs. Additionally, we have implemented a map feature focused on Montreal that allows users to find healthcare professionals and facilities for both physical and mental health. The application uses cutting-edge technologies such as JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, HTTP, and REST APIs, and we store user data securely in a MongoDB database.To ensure a seamless and user-friendly experience, we have utilized popular UI frameworks such as Material UI and Styled Components. Our code is hosted on GitHub, making it easy for developers to contribute and collaborate on the project.
