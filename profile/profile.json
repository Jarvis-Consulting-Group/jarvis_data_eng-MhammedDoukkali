My excellent track record in collaborating with team members, coupled with my ability to proactively address the needs of both customers and the organization, has honed my communication and problem-solving skills. My passion for software engineering began while working on a project to improve the online banking application. Intrigued by the power of programming to create and build solutions, I decided to enroll in an 'Introduction to Programming' course. Quickly, I found programming to be highly accessible and was thrilled to see the immediate results of my work in just a few lines of code. Currently, as an Applications and Data Engineer at Jarvis, I have honed my proficiency in various technologies such as Java, Linux, and Docker. I have demonstrated my ability to work in a fast-paced environment and deliver high-quality solutions. I am eager to leverage my skills and knowledge to contribute to your team's succes."
