      "description": "Developed full-stack web application that provides comprehensive information on both physical and mental health. Users can access a wide range of health-related articles on various topics, as well as track their physical activity and mental health using external REST APIs. Additionally, we have implemented a map feature focused on Montreal that allows users to find healthcare professionals and facilities for both physical and mental health. The application uses cutting-edge technologies such as JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, HTTP, and REST APIs, and we store user data securely in a MongoDB database.To ensure a seamless and user-friendly experience, we have utilized popular UI frameworks such as Material UI and Styled Components. Our code is hosted on GitHub, making it easy for developers to contribute and collaborate on the project.",

        "Twitter App: Designed a Twitter application that follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, enabling users to execute CRUD operations via REST API. To build the application, I utilized various libraries such as Twitter API, HTTP client, OAuth authorization, and JSON serialization. During the development process, I conducted integration tests on all Java files using JUnit. Additionally, I employed the Mockito framework to test classes with dependencies, leveraging the ability to mock those dependencies.",
        "JDBC App: Programmed a straightforward application that establishes a link between a Java program and a relational database management system (RDBMS) to access data. To enable create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations, I utilized the DAO (data access object) design patterns.",
        "Grep App: Developed a Java program that imitates the grep command line function. The program performs a recursive search for a given pattern within a specified root directory and writes the matching lines to an output file. To efficiently list and filter files under the root directory while reducing memory usage, I utilized the Lambda and Stream API."
